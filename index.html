					You will be amazed at the thoroughness of our new patient exam. At Glisten Dental, this means personal
					attention from our team of doctors, assistants and hygienists. They will provide you with a complete

					necessary digital x-rays and an oral cancer screening. We continue by capturing a series of high definition
					photos of your mouth – so you can see what we see. And, we evaluate the health of existing crowns, inlays,
					onlays, dentures or partial dentures.</p>
